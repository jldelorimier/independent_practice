// TIL:
// ++R is a syntax that would take the current value of R and increment it? How is this different than R++? Looks like R++ does not increment it on the spot, whereas ++R does. So if R is currently 0, then ++R means Â¿'use one more than the value of R for R, and reassign R that value now' (I think)? 
// The internet says: "++i returns the value of i after it has been incremented. i++ returns the value of i before incrementing. When the ++ comes after it is called the "post-increment" operator.

I'm kind of confused why s[0] === s[3] runs at all. I guess R has to be incremented to test it, and the incremented value still remains once you get the to console.log line returning "return 0:2".
  }//; // i.e. while the leftmost side of this "center" is the same letter as the current right increment that we're on.... i.e. as we iterate through the while loop, R is going to keep incrementing by 1 and moving further right down the string to test further out cheracters against the leftmost character.
  //wow, is that one line the whole while loop? there's no {} then part of this while loop. So it's just saying increment R while s[R] == s[L]? So I guess we're only using this loop to set up R?
  console.log("R is " + R) // At this line, R = 3. So R is actually incremented one more time in the last run of the while loop, but s[0] = c and s[3] = a, so s[0] != s[3], so that's the last time it runs. On the next line, we have to use the index to the left of the currently logged R. So we need to do R-1, not just R.

When we go through this for loop again and rerun getCenter() and expandAroundCenter(), it will be starting with the character after the current center as the next starting i.
